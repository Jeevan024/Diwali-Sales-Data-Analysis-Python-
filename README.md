<p>Diwali sales data analysis using Python involves processing and analyzing sales data from the Diwali season to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends. The process includes data cleaning to ensure accuracy, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and customer demographics, and sales performance analysis to identify top-selling products and revenue patterns. Additionally, customer segmentation helps in understanding different consumer groups, while seasonal trends analysis highlights sales spikes during Diwali. Predictive analysis can be applied to forecast future sales using historical data. Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are commonly used for these tasks.</p>
